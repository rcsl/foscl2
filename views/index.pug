			h1 Friends of Sonning Common Library
			p.lead Friends of Sonning Common Library (FoSCL) exists to promote and support the library by providing it with resources and by working for the continuation of an effective library service. 
			p Cuts to the library budgets have threatened libraries throughout the UK. Sonning Common Library is amongst many smaller libraries that are now supported by volunteers and the activities of a Friends Group.

			p First set up in 1998, the Friends Group has helped fight two successful campaigns to save the library â€“ the most recent in 2010/11. Since August 2014 our team of volunteers have supported the professional staff by, among other things, shelving books, running story-times, helping customers use the self-service machines and delivering books to people in the community. 
			p FoSCL also raises additional funds to replace the shortfall created by County Council budget cuts. Our main sources of funds are membership fees and donations. As a charity we are able to reclaim tax on individual donations through gift-aid.
			p FoSCL is managed by an Executive Committee elected by the members at its Annual General Meeting.  A copy of our #[a(href='download/constitution') constitution can be downloaded] or viewed in the library.
